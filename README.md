# chat_app DEMO

This app utilizes the GPT API, delivering a natural chat experience. With your API key, you have the freedom to choose between GPT3 and GPT4! If you want to adjust the accuracy of the conversation, a token count adjustment feature is also available for your convenience.

üß† Using the app's memory feature, you can maintain the flow of conversation. Additionally, the ability to visualize the number of tokens used and delete conversation content enables you to fully control the use of the app.

‚òÅÔ∏è This is not a cloud-based app. Once downloaded, all conversation data is stored in your environment, protecting your privacy.

‚ö†Ô∏è Since this is a demo version, there might be some minor bugs. However, we encourage you to experience the potential of artificial intelligence that lies beyond.
